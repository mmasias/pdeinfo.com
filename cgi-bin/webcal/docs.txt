         WebCal 1.21 by Darryl C. Burgdorf (burgdorf@awsd.com)

                    http://awsd.com/scripts/webcal/

              ===========================================

WebCal allows you to create and maintain an interactive events
calendar or scheduling system on your Web site.  The script can create
calendars for any desired month from 1601 to 2899 A.D.; events to be
displayed are stored in an easily-maintained data file.  The data file
can include singular, weekly, monthly and annual events, and those
events can be linked to outside URLs for additional information.
Calendars can be viewed in several different table grid formats or
as simple text listings.

WebCal is shareware.  If you use it, please register it!  The
registration fee is only $25 (US).  Payment should be sent via check
or money order to Darryl C. Burgdorf, Affordable Web Space Design,
3524 Pacific Street, Omaha NE 68105.

              ===========================================

The files that you need are as follows:

webcal.pl:  The script which allows users to view your calendars.

webcal.add.pl:  The script which allows you to add new events to your
  calendar database.

webcal.delete.pl:  The script which allows you to delete entries from
  your calendar database.  (The two admin functions are contained in
  separate scripts so that you may, if you like, easily allow users to
  add events to your calendar without also allowing them access to the
  delete functions.)

webcal.config.pl:  The file containing the configuration variables used
  by all of the above scripts.

data.astro.txt, data.holiday.txt and data.jewish.txt:  Example calendar
  databases, listing astronomical events (equinoxes, solstices, etc.),
  major US holidays and celebrations, and major Jewish holidays and
  celebrations, for the years 1995 through 2005.

              ===========================================

SETTING UP WEBCAL:

Setting up WebCal is quite easy.  Make sure that the first line of each
of the scripts points correctly to the location of Perl on your system,
that they are all set world-executable ("chmod a+x <scriptname>"), and
that the "require" line near the top of each one points correctly to
your configuration file.  (You may want to put the admin scripts in a
password-protected directory.)  Make sure, as well, that your data file
is set world-writable ("chmod a+w <filename").

The variables in the configuration file are as follows:

$cgiurl:  The URL of the main calendar display script.
$addcgiurl:  The URL of the "add" script.
$deletecgiurl:  The URL of the "delete" script.

@datafiles:  The absolute paths -- not the URLs -- of your events data
  files.  You can have as many as you like, so you could, for example,
  have one or more (such as those provided with the script) to store
  "static" holiday info, another to store "official" events, and yet
  another to store events entered by your visitors.  You could even set
  up distinct calendars, if you wished, to display varying subsets of
  the list of data files.
  
%editfiles:  Define this variable with a list of the names and paths
  of those files which you want to make accessible to those using the
  add and delete scripts.

$DataDirPath and $DataDirURL:  These variables are optional, and should
  point to the absolute path and URL, respectively, of a world-writable
  data directory in which the script can put information pages about
  events added to the database.  If you leave these variables undefined,
  the event entry form will allow only a short description and URL, and
  the script won't create any new pages.  As well, if the directory
  you've specified doesn't exist or if the script is unable to write
  to it, no option for the creation of information pages will be
  available.

$DataDir_header and $DataDir_footer:  The full paths to optional text
  files containing HTML code to be placed at the top and bottom of the
  "information" pages.

$bodyspec:  Any attributes (BACKGROUND, BGCOLOR, TEXT, etc.) which
  should be assigned to the <BODY> tag on admin pages.

$header_file and $footer_file:  The full paths to optional text files
  containing HTML code to be placed at the top and bottom of calendar
  and/or admin pages.  This allows you to include certain "standard"
  information on all of those pages.

$CalendarTitle:  An (optional) title to be used on your calendar pages.

$DisplayCounter:  If this variable is set to 1, the full-size table
  version of the calendar will display on each date a "counter" of the
  number of days gone in the year and the number yet to go (e.g.,
  "364/1").  If you prefer that the counter not be displayed, simply
  leave this variable undefined.

$DisplayPhases:  WebCal can, if you wish, calculate and display lunar
  phases on your calendar pages.  If you prefer that it not do so, just
  leave this variable undefined.
  
$DefaultType:  This variable sets the "default" calendar style for your
  displays.  It can be set to either "Table", "Small Table" or "Text".

$SmallTableText:  If you set this variable to 1, small table displays
  will be accompanied by a textual listing of the events for that month.
  If you set it to 0, no such listing will be included.  This can be
  handy if, for example, you're displaying timeshare availability.
  While you'd want visitors to know whether certain dates were already
  booked, you wouldn't necessarily want them to know *who* booked them.

$PreviousLastOnly:  If this variable is set to 1, visitors will *only*
  have the option to move back or forward one month at a time.  They
  won't be able to select specific months, and they won't be able to
  alter the calendar style.

$AllowUserChoice:  If this variable is set to 1, visitors won't be able
  alter the calendar style, but *will* still have the option to select
  specific months (unless, of course, $PreviousLastOnly is also set).

$AllowHTML:  If this variable is set to 1, HTML code is allowed in
  calendar entries.  If it is set to 0, HTML code is stripped.

$AllowMultiDate:  If this variable is set to 1, it will be possible to
  enter events not only for specific dates, but also for date ranges.

$bgcolor_normal:  The color (defined with standard HTML RGB hex code) to
  be used as the background for "normal" dates (dates with no events) on
  the graphic calendar.

$bgcolor_header:  The color to be used as the background for the header
  (month line) at the top of the calendar.

$bgcolor_special:  The color to be used as the background for dates on
  which an event occurs.

$textcolor_normal:  The text color to be used for for "normal" dates on
  the calendar.

$textcolor_header:  The text color to be used for the header.

$textcolor_today:  The text color to be used for today's date on the
  calendar.

$textcolor_special:  The text color to be used for event listings.

$TableFont:  The "FACE" specification (if any) that you want used in
  your calendar tables.  If you've defined a font style for the page
  as a whole, and want it used in the calendar tables, as well, define
  it here, as otherwise, Netscape Navigator will use a visitor's default
  font within the tables, no matter what's used on the rest of the page.
  You can also use this, of course, to deliberately define a font for
  the tables different from the one you've used on the rest of the page.

$HourOffset:  If you are in one time zone and your Web host is in
  another, you can use this variable to make sure that your calendar
  always shows the correct date for your location.  For example, if your
  server is located in the Eastern time zone, but you're in the Pacific
  time zone, set it to "-3".

$MonSunWeek:  If set to 1, calendar weeks will run from Monday to Sunday
  rather than from Sunday to Monday.  (This can be handy if you list a
  lot of Saturday/Sunday events and want the weekend days to be more
  clearly "linked" visually.)

              ===========================================

USING WEBCAL:

You (or, if you desire, your visitors) can add events to the database
simply by calling the webcal.add.pl script.  You'll be presented with an
input form; just input the date(s) on which the event will (or did)
occur, a brief description of the event, and, optionally, a URL address
to which that description should link.  If you wish the event to show up
on a certain date *every* year, simply define the year as "x".  This is
handy, for example, for inputting holidays which fall on the same date
each year.  (If you input a year as only one or two digits, the script
will assume that it falls between 1950 and 2049.  For example, 98 will
be automatically converted to 1998, and 1 will be automatically
converted to 2001.)

You can delete events from the database by calling the webcal.delete.pl
script.  You'll be presented with a chronological list of *every* event
in the database.  Simply checkmark the event(s) you wish to delete, and
click on the "delete" button.

To view calendars, just call the main webcal.pl script.  When you first
visit, you'll see a tabular (grid) calendar of the current month, unless
of course another view has been defined as the default.  From that screen,
you can select any month you desire, and/or, if permitted, change the
display style.

              ===========================================

ABOUT THE PERPETUAL CALENDAR SUBROUTINE:

The perpetual calendar routine I wrote for WebCal provides accurate
day/date correspondences for dates from 1601 to 2899 A.D.  It is based
on the Gregorian calendar, so be aware that early correspondences may
not always be historically accurate.  The Gregorian calendar was adopted
by the Italian states, Portugal and Spain in 1582, and by the Catholic
German states in 1583.  However, it was not adopted by the Protestant
German states until 1699, by England and its colonies until 1752, by
Sweden until 1753, by Japan until 1873, by China until 1912, by the
Soviet Union until 1918, and by Greece until 1923.

              ===========================================

REGISTERING WEBCAL:

WebCal is shareware.  If you use it, please register it!  The
registration fee is only $25 (US).  Payment should be sent via check or
money order to Darryl C. Burgdorf, Affordable Web Space Design, 3524
Pacific Street, Omaha NE 68105.

(If you happen to live in a country other than the United States, you
can write a check in your local currency for the equivalent of $32.50.
That will cover the $25 registration fee and the $7.50 service fee which
my bank charges.  Please do *not* write me a check in US funds drawn on
a non-US bank; the service charge for those can be anywhere from $10 to
$25!)

The unregistered version of the script is not crippled in any way.  I'm
not trying to "coerce" anyone into sending me money.  But I don't think
it's an unreasonable request.  I believe WebCal is a commercial-
quality product; a *lot* of work has gone into its creation.  If you
use it and make money with it, I'd appreciate it if you would be kind
enough to send in the registration fee.  I'll be that much more likely
to be able to continue spending time and effort on the scripts in the
WebScripts collection, and you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you
did the right thing.  ;)
